Synopsis:
The project is a python based program that uses Python Image Library to display the information about the images that match the given criteria and copy all the photos from a directory tree that matches the given criteria.

Motivation:
This project was assigned to me as a part of my training task. I was suggested to use python as the programming language.

Installation:
The procedures to run this project are:
i. First of all create a folder named 'Matched' in the parent directory.
ii. In the terminal/command prompt go to the location of your destined folder
iii. Then type 'python filename.py' and then press enter
As the program runs, it displays the information of the images that matches the criteria and then copies all these images to the 'Matched' in your parent directory.
