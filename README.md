Synopsis:
The project is a python based program that uses Python Image Library to print the names and copy all the photos from a directory tree that has size greater than 1024*768 resolution. 

Motivation:
This project was assigned to me as a part of my training task. I was suggested to use python as the programming language.

Installation:
The procedures to run this project are:
i. Copy the code in python IDLE.
ii. Save the project in any folder with numerous pictures.
iii. Create a new folder named 'Matched' in the parent directory.
iv. You can run the project module by pressing F5 on your keyboard
    As the program runs, it displays the name, format and size of all the pictures in your directory tree and copies the pictures to the folder named 'Matched' in parent directory.
